# Installing the software

## What do you need?


We assume you have a laptop (Windows or Mac). To be able to follow the course and use the software for other courses you need the following free software:

- R
- Rstudio
- TinyTex
- R packages

R is free software for importing data, manipulating data and statistical analysis. Once installed, you don't need to open the software.

We will use R in another program: Rstudio. Rstudio is a so called Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which allows you to write and run code.

Rstudio is able to transform your code to different nice outputs:

- notebook
- presentation
- article
- thesis
- much more (even this website and this course manual is build in Rstudio!)

Rstudio needs TinyTex to transform your code to pdf.

If you need to do things more often, it is useful to write a function to do these things. Other R users also use functions and store them in packages. Some of these packages are published online and can be used by all users. We will depend in our course on some of these packages.

The first package we will install is the package TinyTex, which is basically a function to install the TinyTex software on your computer, taking into account your operating system.

We also show you how to install other packages.

In this chapter we will instruct how to install the software.


## Installing R

In this paragraph we will take you through the steps to install R.

1. Go to this [website](https://mirror.lyrahosting.com/CRAN/)
2. Choose download R for your operating system. You can choose from Windows, Mac OS X for apple computers and Linux. If you don't know which operating system you have and you don't have an apple computer, you may guess you have a Windows computer.
3. After downloading, open the dowloaded file and follow the steps to install the program. Choose the default options.
